For the two nodes to be exchanged, our idea is to insert the second node before the first node. For example: `pre -> head -> head.next -> head.next.next`, it should become: `pre -> head.next -> head -> head.next.next`. Then, `pre` moves forward two places, `head` forward one place, and continue to exchange.

For the convenience of writing code, you can create several more variables to represent the nodes of the linked list, such asï¼š`pre -> head -> next -> temp`, it should become: `pre -> next -> head -> temp`.

The time complexity is `O(n)`, the space complexity is `O(1)`.

``` java
public ListNode swapPairs(ListNode head) {
    ListNode dummy = new ListNode();
    dummy.next = head;
    ListNode pre = dummy;
    while (head != null && head.next != null) {
        /**************************/
        ListNode next = head.next;
        ListNode temp = next.next;
        pre.next = next;
        next.next = head;
        head.next = temp;
        /**************************/
        head = head.next;
        pre = pre.next.next;
    }
    return dummy.next;
}
```
